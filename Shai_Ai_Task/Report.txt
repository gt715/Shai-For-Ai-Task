 I am writing to present the findings and insights from a recent data analysis task I completed. The 
task involved exploring a dataset containing employee information, including various components of 
pay and job details.
The dataset comprises 148,654 entries, each representing an employee, across 13 columns. These 
columns include 'Id', 'EmployeeName', 'JobTitle', 'BasePay', 'OvertimePay', 'OtherPay', 'Benefits', 
'TotalPay', 'TotalPayBenefits', 'Year', 'Notes', 'Agency', and 'Status'.
In this analysis, 'TotalPayBenefits' was used to represent the total salary of an employee, which 
includes base pay, overtime pay, other pay, and benefits.
Before diving into the analysis, I conducted a thorough data quality check. I found that several 
columns contained null values and negative values. To address these issues, I cleaned the data by 
setting negative values to 0, filling null values with 0, and dropping the 'Notes' and 'Status' columns. 
Post-cleaning, I confirmed that all numeric columns were free of negative values and all columns 
were free of null values.
The analysis revealed several interesting patterns and correlations:
1.	Salary Components: 'BasePay', 'OvertimePay', and 'OtherPay' showed a positive correlation 
with the total salary, suggesting they are significant contributors to the total pay benefits.
2.	Job Titles: The most common job titles were 'Transit Operator', 'Special Nurse', 'TRANSIT 
OPERATOR', 'Registered Nurse', 'Firefighter', 'Police Officer 3', and 'Custodian'.
3.	Salary Trends Over Time: The average, median, and standard deviation of total salary 
grouped by 'Year' showed a general increase from 2011 to 2014.
4.	Department-wise Salary: When grouped by 'Department', the 'Fire Department' had higher 
average and median total salaries than the 'Police Department'.
5.	Yearly Department-wise Salary: When grouped by both 'Department' and 'Year', the 'Fire 
Department' saw a significant increase in average total salary from 2011 to 2014, while the 
'Police Department' saw a more gradual increase.
Conclusion : The insights derived from this analysis provide a comprehensive understanding of the 
salary structure and trends within the organization. These findings can guide strategic decisions 
related to compensation, budget allocation, and workforce planning.
